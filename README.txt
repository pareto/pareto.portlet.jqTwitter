!!! Twitter broke the old API, don't use anymore.

Introduction
============
This product installs a Plone portlet which shows tweets of a twitter user or 
hashtag search. Instead of using the python integration with twitter is uses
the twitter javascript api. It loads the tweets asynchoniously. This api has a 
limit of 150 calls per hour per ip, this should not pose a problem for most 
users.
